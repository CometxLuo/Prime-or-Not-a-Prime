    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, in order to research the properties of one kind of numbers that are unfamiliar to the general public, we deeply utilize the features of prime numbers and congruences to analyze them. However, find out a number which is not a prime but was hold for the Fermat's little theorem is not an easy thing. In virtue of the power of computer and Python, we can calculate and test based on our demand in a short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, we need to write out the following functions: 1) `is_prime` function, which determine whether the input is prime; 2) `is_prime_like` function, which decide whether the input can pass the Fermat's little theorem. Moreoevr, combine the two functions above to create a new function `is_false_prime` that can determine whether the input is false prime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, decompose the false primes we found by using the `my_primes` and `primary` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, observe the results, and try to sperate them on each other, to see if we can come up with any patterns.\n",
